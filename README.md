<h2> üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ... </h2>

-I'm currently expanding my expertise in various AWS domains, including computing, networking, storage, and database services. Additionally, I'm deepening my understanding of AWS deployment and management services. This journey involves gaining knowledge and skills in deploying, managing, and operating workloads on AWS, while also focusing on implementing security controls and meeting compliance requirements.

I'm becoming proficient in utilizing the AWS Management Console and mastering the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). Moreover, I'm familiarizing myself with essential concepts such as the AWS Well-Architected Framework, AWS networking, security services, and the AWS global infrastructure.

As part of this learning process, I'm developing the ability to identify the most suitable AWS services for specific technical requirements and proficiently defining technical requirements for AWS-based applications. I plan to put my knowledge to the test by taking the Amazon Solution Architect Associate certification exam by the end of November.
